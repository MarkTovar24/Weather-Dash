# Weather Dashboard

## What I had to do:
- Create a dashboard that shows 5 day forecast of a city typed into the input
- store previous searches in local storage
- use OpenWeather api and dayJS 

## What I did
- Honestly, I had no idea what I was doing
- I'm only submitting this unfinished products because I don't want to get kicked out and I want to move and and try to recover from my mistakes from procrastination.
- There is an unfinished HTML structure, No CSS and an unfinished JS script file.
- I really don't want to have to resort to this again.
